# Comment Component

### Steps to run project

Development: `npm run dev`

Test: `npm run test`

Build: `npm run build`

# Requirements
- The component displays a list of comments
- The user can enter a text and click a button to add the comment to the list
- The user can delete a comment from the list
- Comments can be nested: The user can comment on another comment
- Comments are persisted: Restarting/ refreshing the app does not clear comments
- Bonus points if the component works across multiple tabs without refreshing the page
